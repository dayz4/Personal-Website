			<h2> ~ About Me ~ </h2>
			<hr class="thickline"> <br>
			<p> Hi there, my name's Daisy! <br><br></p>
			<h4> Computer Science </h4>
			<p>
				I'm currently a sophomore studying
				computer science at Cornell University, set to graduate in May
				2018. I chose computer science because I love to create new things
				and solve puzzles, and computer science is a field that encompasses
				those things and so much more. I am particularly interested in
				computer vision and graphics, but I have interest in several other
				areas of computer science as well, including game development and
				cyber security.
				<br><br>
				I am constantly amazed by the power
				that just a few (or many) lines of code hold. Computer science has allowed
				us as a society to accomplish things we never thought possible, and
				I look forward to continuing to push that boundary that separates
				the impossible from the possible.
				<br><br>
				Check out my <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> section for some examples of the kinds of
				projects I've worked on, or take a look at my <a href="resume.html">Resume</a> to learn more!
				<br><br>
			</p>

			<h4> Photography </h4>
				<p>
				I am also an avid photograper.
				I was originally inspired to seriously start photography back in
				2011. What started simply as a way to document my summer quickly
				grew into a love of capturing those fleeting moments in life that
				ordinarily would just pass us by.
				I believe the supposedly ordinary things in the world can be
				extraordinary in their own right if only you stop for a moment
				and look. That’s what I try to capture in my photography. It's more
				than the way I view photography - it's the way I view the world.
				<br><br>
				Photography has taken me to amazing places, both literally and
				figuratively, and I’ll continue to follow it —  wherever the
				clouds take me next.
				<br><br>
				If you're interested in seeing more of my photography, check out my photoblog,

				<h4 style="text-align: center"> <a href="visualization.html" style="color: black">Data Visualization</a> </h4>
				<img src="stylesheets/images/data_vis_screenshot.png" style="width: 100%">
				<p>
					<br> A visualization of educational standards and the
					"cross walks" between them. This is designed as a tool to
					help teachers and other educational workers design well-rounded
					curriculums	that best encompass the skills that children need to learn
					in order to succeed.<br><br>
					This visualization includes features such as hover highlighting and tooltips,
					collapsing/expanding, zooming, "sticky" nodes, and graph selection/toggling.
					<br><br>
					Written in HTML and JavaScript using D3.
				</p>

				</div>
				<p>
					Eat or... well just eat and don't crash!
					Snake is back! It's the classic game of eat and don't crash,
					only this time your opponenet isn't just yourself. Race the AI
					around the board and eat, eat, eat! Better eat fast, because
					in this world, it's not just about survival of the fittest - it's
					about survival of the biggest.

			<div class="project">
				<h4 style="text-align: center"> Honeypot </h4>
				<img src="stylesheets/images/honeypot_screenshot.png" style="width: 100%">
				<p>
					<br> A synchronized multicore honeypot that receives data packets and
					detects if they are spam, evil, or vulnerable packets. Command packets
					are received occassionally that updates the listings of spam, evil, or
					vulnerable addresses or gives the honeypot other commands such as
					printing stats. Stats can also be printed via any keystroke.
