				<h4>I write code that visualizes the world.</h4>

					Whether it's data, images, visual effects, or fantastical landscapes, 
					I like to write programs that visually make sense of the world or

				<h4>Where I've been</h4>
				<h5 class="left-aligned">Yext</h5>
				<p>
					I'm in my second year at Yext now, having been here since July 2018. Originally I was 
					a member of the R&D Team, and for awhile I was the only full-time developer on the team 
					(just me and my manager, it was a wild ride). Those few months were filled with some of 
					the most challenging yet fulfilling experiences I've had at Yext so far. I was able to 
					grow so much as an engineer and an individual during this time and I wouldn't have had 
					it any other way. Eventually, my tiny team got merged into another team. Despite leaving 
					the R&D team, I didn't leave R&D duties behind. There's always something new and exciting 
					happening here, and I'm lucky that I get to be here to contribute to it.
				</p>
				<h5 class="left-aligned">Biogen</h5>
				<p>
					The summer of my junior year of college, I interned at Biogen, a biotechnology corporation 
					located in the Boston area. This experience left a deep impression on me and played a large 
					role in shaping my plans for future. It's there that I had the unique opportunity to tackle 
					a problem that's continued to plague even the biggest biotech players out there. Though I 
					won't be so arrogant as to claim that my solution was perfect when seasoned professionals 
					have been pooling their resources towards developing their own solutions, it <i>was</i> 
					complete and more importantly, it <i>worked</i>. Over the course of three months, I had 
					successfully written a program from scratch that could analyze 3D neuronal microscopy scans, 
					the structures that individual voxels corresponded to, compile metrics on the relational 
					structure of the neuron and the density of dendritic spines, and visualize the results in 
					interactive 3D.

				<h4>My life has shaped my story, even if it does not define it.</h4>
				<br>
				<p>
					<span class="emph"><b>I grew up with computers.</b></span>
					Given the generation I grew up in, I suppose that's hardly surprising. Still, 
					it plays an important role in the direction my life took. For a time, it probably 
					seemed like I would stray towards the ECE side of things, given my propensity for 
					"playing" with my parents' soldering tools. In the end, it was the sheer power of 
					code to contribute to a diverse array of fields that propelled me down a different 
					path, a path that led me towards computer science.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					<span class="emph"><b>Still, some passions you just can't leave behind.</b></span>
					I'm a person with many, sometimes conflicting, interests. I have long harbored a love 
					of biology, a love that hasn't truly lessened since the day in 3rd grade when I 
					declared that I wanted to be a marine biologist and study dolphins. Though I had 
					made the decision to major in Computer Science when I came to Cornell, I knew that 
					I would also be taking my share of biology courses (with the end goal of one day finding 
					a way to apply computer science to the field of biology), so it only made sense to get 
					the Biological Sciences minor as well.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					<span class="emph"><b>If there's one thing I've learned, it's that life takes determination.</b></span>
					Gymnastics takes a lot of things - strength, grit, hard work, mental fortitude... Most of all, 
					though, it takes determination. Growing up as a competitive gymnast who dreamed of going to 
					the Olympics, I learned this lesson well. We had a saying at my gym: "Eat like a champion, 
					sleep like a champion, live like a champion.". To be the best, it's not enough to be just a 
					punch-clock gymnast (or developer, or artist, or anything else). To be the best, you have to 
					live and breathe your passions, you have to be willing to do whatever it takes, whenever it 
					takes, for however long it takes. This is a lesson I've carried with me through my whole life, 
					and it's one I'll never forget.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					<span class="emph"><b>Exploration is boundless.</b></span>
					Explorations. Expeditions. New frontiers. These are things that have always fascinated me. 
					For me, it started with just exploring my neighborhood or the back woods. Then it moved on 
					to the country. Then it expanded to the entire world. Of course, my definition of exploration 
					isn't limited to physical lands. There are frontiers in science and technology, art, knowledge, 
					and any other number of imaginable fields just waiting to be discovered. This is part of the 
					reason why I love computer science and biology so much: they are two of the most rapidly 
					evolving fields existing at this moment, with so many areas just waiting to be explored.
				</p>

				<h4>Oh, and did I mention that I'm a photographer, too?</h4>
				<br>
				<p>
					I was originally inspired to seriously start photography back in
					2011. What started simply as a way to document my summer quickly
					grew into a love of capturing those fleeting moments in life that
					ordinarily would just pass us by.
					<br><br>
					Along my journey, I’ve encountered a lot of conflicting philosophies
					on just what it means to be a photographer. Some saw photography as art,
					others saw it as truth. It's made me think a lot about where I stand, but
					all I really know right now is that I believe in capturing how I see the world.
					Whether that’s the ‘truth’ or not, well that’s up for debate. But 
					<span class="emph">whatever it is, it’s my truth</span>. I never set out to 
					be a photojournalist, and I didn’t set out to be an artist either. All I 
					wanted was to <span class="emph">remember the moment</span>, to capture those 
					stories and those emotions and all the countless other things that make up that 
					<span class="emph">little piece of history</span>. And that’s still what
					I want, and it will continue to be what I want. <span class="emph">That much I 
					know for sure</span>.
