				<h4>I write code that visualizes the world.</h4>
				<p>
					Whether it's data, images, visual effects, or fantastical landscapes, 
					I like to write code that visually make sense of the world or 
					imagination. So far, this has fallen under 4 main categories:
					<ul class="centered">
						<li>Computer Vision</li>
						<li>Graphics</li>
						<li>Game Development</li>
						<li>Data Visualization</li>

				<h4>I write code that makes sense of biological data.</h4>
				<p>
					I've always been fascinated by biology, and there is still so much more left to 
					discover, both in terms of pushing technology forward and improving the lives of patients 
					suffering from diseases. There's a ton of data out there, but not a great way of sifting through 
					it all to find the important pieces hidden inside. I've started tackling this problem through 
					machine learning. In the past, I've worked on projects to identify Diabetic Retinopathy from 
					retinal scans, trace and classify structures in neuron images, detect autism through fMRI scans, 
					and decompose EMG signals from muscle activation data.

				<h4>My skills are varied</h4>

					I've worked on projects across the entire software stack, using languages and libraries such as:

						<li>PyTorch, WebGL, Three.js, D3, NumPy, OpenCV, Scikit-Image.</li>

				<h4>Where I've been</h4>
				<h5 class="left-aligned">Yext</h5>
				<p>
					I worked at Yext for two years right out of graduation, from July 2018 to August 2020.
					Originally I was 
					a member of the R&D Team, and for some time I was the only full-time developer on the team 
					- it was just me and my manager. Those few months were filled with some of 
					the most challenging yet fulfilling experiences I've had at Yext so far. I was able to 
					grow so much as an engineer and an individual during this time and I wouldn't have had 
					it any other way. Eventually, my tiny team got merged into another team. Despite leaving 
					the R&D team, I didn't leave R&D duties behind. On my new team, I got the chance to lay 
					the groundwork for an entirely new backend system that will eventually replace the current 
					system that the team's services run on, building it from the ground up and evolving right 
					alongside the cutting edge of the company's technology. After developing this system into 
					a working prototype, I moved to the newly formed R&D team to work on the company's flagship 
					product, Answers, an effort that spanned multiple teams and departments. There was always 
					something new and exciting happening at Yext, and I feel lucky that I got to be there to 
					contribute to it.
				</p>
				<h5 class="left-aligned">Corteva</h5>
				<p>
					The summer after my first year of graduate school, I interned at Corteva, a agriscience company 
					that is researching ways to help feed the world. While this was a difficult time in terms of the 
					pandemic, it was still a great experience that allowed me to develop many important skills. Through 
					this internship, I gained a deep understanding into how AWS worked and how to build and deploy complex 
					software systems into a cloud environment, as well as hands-on experince working with Docker 
					container setup and orchestration. These are technologies that are only going to grow in importance 
					in the future, and I feel all the more confident going forward now that I've had these experiences 
					to learn from.
				</p>
				<h5 class="left-aligned">Biogen</h5>
				<p>
					The summer of my junior year of college, I interned at Biogen, a biotechnology corporation 
					located in the Boston area. This experience left a deep impression on me and played a large 
					role in shaping my plans for future. It's there that I had the unique opportunity to tackle 
					a problem that's continued to plague even the biggest biotech players out there. Over the 
					course of three months, I built a program from scratch that could analyze 3D neuronal 
					microscopy scans, identify the structures that individual voxels corresponded to, compile 
					metrics on the relational structure of the neuron and the density of dendritic spines, and 
					visualize the results in interactive 3D. Throughout the process, I worked with mentors from 
					both the neuroscience side and the computer science side to bridge the two disciplines and 
					understand the problem I was trying to solve from both angles. This whole experience 
					culminated in a poster session where I presented to attendees from all areas of the company, 
					even leaving enough of an impression on the CIO himself that he featured my poster in the 
					company-wide newsletter the next day.

				<h4>I'm a photographer, too!</h4>
				<br>
				<p>
					I was originally inspired to seriously start photography back in
					2011. What started simply as a way to document my summer quickly
					grew into a love of capturing those fleeting moments in life that
					ordinarily would just pass us by.
					<br><br>
					Along my journey, I’ve encountered a lot of conflicting philosophies
					on just what it means to be a photographer. Some saw photography as art,
					others saw it as truth. It's made me think a lot about where I stand, but
					all I really know right now is that I believe in capturing how I see the world.
					Whether that’s the ‘truth’ or not is up for debate. But whatever it is, it’s 
					<i>my</i> truth. I never set out to be a photojournalist, and I didn’t set
					out to be an artist either. All I wanted was to remember the moment, to capture
					those stories and emotions and all the countless other things that make up that 
					little piece of history. And that’s still what I want, and that will continue to 
					be what I want. That much I know for sure.
