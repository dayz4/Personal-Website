					<h4>The name's Zheng. Daisy Zheng.</h4>
					<br>
					<p>
						I'm currently a senior attending <span class="emph">Cornell University</span>, set 
						to graduate in May 2018 with a <span class="emph">B.S. in Computer Science</span> 
						and a <span class="emph">minor in Biological Sciences.</span> 
						Outside of my professional and academic pursuits, I'm also an avid photographer, athlete, artist, 
						writer, and guitarist.

					<h4>I write code that visualizes the world.</h4>
					<br>
					<p>
						Whether it's visual effects, images, data, or fantastical landscapes, 
						I like to write programs that visually make sense of some aspect of our world or 
						imagination. So far, this has fallen under 4 main categories:
						<ul>
							<li>Graphics</li>
							<li>Computer Vision</li>
							<li>Game Development</li>
							<li>Data Visualization</li>
						</ul>

						</div>
						I've worked on projects across the entire software stack, using languages including:
						<ul>
							<li>Python, Java, OCaml, C, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS</li>
						</ul>
						and utilizing libraries such as:
						<ul>
							<li>WebGL, Three.js, D3, NumPy, OpenCV, and Scikit-Image.</li>
						</ul>

					<h4>I'll let my experience speak for itself.</h4>
					<br>
					<p>
						Professionally speaking, I've spent my last 2 summers interning at companies working 
						on computer vision projects. My first internship, at the startup <span class="emph">
						Infinity ProAV,</span> involved implementing and optimizing a <span class="emph">3D 
						stereo reconstruction algorithm</span> that could be used in real-time vehicle detection. 
						Lectures and school projects can really only take you so far: this internship gave me 
						the chance to test my mettle against a real business need. Though there was a lot for me to 
						learn, this is one thing I'm willing to take pride it: <span class="emph">I will do whatever 
						it takes, and learn whatever I need to, in order to accomplish my goals.</span>
						<br><br>
						My next internship, this time at the biotechnology corporation <span class="emph">Biogen
						</span>, I had the unique opportunity to tackle a problem that's continued to plague even 
						the biggest biotech players out there. Though it would be downright arrogant to claim that 
						my solution was perfect when professional companies have pooled all their resources on trying 
						to develop their own solutions, it <i>was</i> complete and most importantly, it <i>worked</i>. 
						I had successfully built a program from scratch that could <span class="emph">analyze 3D 
						neuronal microscopy scans</span>, identify the individual voxels corresponding to different 
						neuron structures, and visualize the results. For Biogen, it was the proof that they needed 
						in order to conclude that building a 3D neuron tracer like I had done was feasible and worth 
						pursuing. For me, it was proof that I have what it takes to <span class="emph">take on a 
						challenge and find a way to solve it.</span>

					<h4>My life has shaped my story, even if it does not define it.</h4>
					<br>
					<p>
						<span class="emph"><b>I grew up with computers.</b></span>
						Given the generation I grew up in, I suppose that's hardly surprising. Still, 
						it plays an important role in the direction my life took. For a time, it probably 
						seemed like I would stray towards the ECE side of things, given my propensity for 
						"playing" with my parents' soldering tools. In the end, it was my fascination with 
						game development and my dream of entering the animation industry that propelled me 
						down a different path, a path that led me towards computer science.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						<span class="emph"><b>Still, some passions you just can't leave behind.</b></span>
						I'm a person with many, sometimes conflicting, passions. I had long harbored a love 
						of biology, a love that hasn't truly lessened since the day in 3rd grade when I 
						declared that I wanted to be a marine biologist and study dolphins. Though I had 
						made the decision to major in Computer Science when I came to Cornell, I knew that 
						I would also be taking my share of biology courses, so it only made sense to take 
						the Biology minor as well.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						<span class="emph"><b>If there's one thing I learned as an athlete, it's that life takes determination.</b></span>
						Gymnastics takes a lot of things - strength, grit, hard work, mental fortitude... Most of all, though, 
						it takes determination. Growing up as a competitive gymnast who dreamed of going to the Olympics, I 
						learned this lesson well. We had a saying at my gym: "Eat like a champion, sleep like a champion, live 
						like a champion.". To be the best, it's not enough to be just a punch-clock gymnast (or developer, or 
						artist, or anything else). To be the best, you have to live and breathe your passions, you have to be 
						willing to do whatever it takes, whenever it takes, for however long it takes. This is a lesson I've 
						carried with me through my whole life, and it's one I'll never forget.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						<span class="emph"><b>This drive to explore: I'll never let it go.</b></span>
						Explorations. Expeditions. New frontiers. These are things that have always fascinated me. For me, it started 
						with just exploring my neighborhood or the back woods. Then it moved on to the country. Then it expanded to 
						the entire world. Of course, my definition of exploration isn't limited to physical lands. There are frontiers 
						in science and technology, art, knowledge, and any other number of imaginable fields just waiting to be discovered, 
						and that idea excites me more than anything. This is part of the reason why I love computer science and biology 
						so much: they are two of the most rapidly evolving fields existing at this moment, with so many areas just waiting 
						to be explored.
					</p>

					<h4>Oh, and did I mention that I'm a photographer, too?</h4>
					<br>
					<p>
						I was originally inspired to seriously start photography back in
						2011. What started simply as a way to document my summer quickly
						grew into a love of capturing those fleeting moments in life that
						ordinarily would just pass us by.
						<br><br>
						Along my journey, I’ve encountered a lot of conflicting philosophies
						on just what it means to be a photographer. Some saw photography as art,
						others saw it as truth. It's made me think a lot about where I stand, but
						all I really know right now is that I believe in capturing how I see the world.
						Whether that’s the ‘truth’ or not, well that’s up for debate. But 
						<span class="emph">whatever it is, it’s my truth</span>. I never set out to 
						be a photojournalist, and I didn’t set out to be an artist either. All I 
						wanted was to <span class="emph">remember the moment</span>, to capture those 
						stories and those emotions and all the countless other things that make up that 
						<span class="emph">little piece of history</span>. And that’s still what
						I want, and it will continue to be what I want. <span class="emph">That much I 
						know for sure</span>.
