				A deadly Plague fills the air, destroying all life in its path.

				known...

			<p>
				Strategic, fast-paced exploration game that pits you against the spreading Plague
				as you race to save your familiars before the Unfamiliars end you.

					concentrated power of will, 5% pleasure, 50% pain, and 100% reason to
					REMEMBER THE NAME."</i>

					You just might go down in history as the world's greatest poker player...
					or end up penniless on the streets. The cards have been dealt. The rest
					is up to you.
