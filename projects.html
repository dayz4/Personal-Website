					Eons of balance have crumbled. The legendary Mount Blaze has fallen into a deep 
					slumber, and the forest tribes have taken the chance to strike back at the coal 
					tribes and reclaim the burnt land. Nicoal, a young coal tribe member, is left 
					alone and devastated when the forest tribe attacks her home. She needs <i>your</i> 
					help to venture past enemy territory and reunite with the other coal tribes. 
					Her journey just might hold the key to answering why Mount Blaze abandoned her 
					people when its people needed it the most.
