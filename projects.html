					Eons of balance have crumbled. The legendary Mount Blaze has fallen into a deep 
					slumber, and the forest tribes have taken the chance to strike back at the coal 
					tribes and reclaim the burnt land. Nicoal, a young coal tribe member, is left 
					alone and devastated when the forest tribe attacks her home. She needs <i>your</i> 
					help to venture past enemy territory and reunite with the other coal tribes. 
					Her journey just might hold the key to answering why Mount Blaze abandoned her 
					people when they needed it the most.

					Fast-paced, sumo-style game with smooth sling mechanics and quick-thinking strategic 
					elements. Knock your enemies into the water before you meet the same fate.

				<a href="airplane.html"><img src="assets/imgs/airplane.gif" style="width: 100%"></a>
				<p>
					Plane boarding is inefficient and unpleasant even on the best of days. There are many different boarding methods that exist, each attempting to streamline the boarding process, but perfection is difficult to achieve.
				</p>
				<p>
					We simulated these boarding methods using multi-agent environment within Unity in an attempt to find the best boarding method out there. Just like in real life scenarios, we incorporating crowd simulation ideas such as collision avoidance and queue formation while passengers stopped to stow their luggage and settle into their seats. The results may surprise you.

				<a href="neurospikes.html"><img src="assets/imgs/neurospikes.png" style="width: 100%"></a>
				<p>
					Real-world EMG (electromyography) data can be messy and hard to interpret, but there's a wealth of information that can be discovered from it. Analyzing these firing patterns and characteristics of motor unit action potentials can provide important insights into a range of applications, from developing treatments for neuromuscular disorders to creating the future of human-computer interfaces.
				</p>
				<p>
					This script takes in real, noisy EMG signal data and uses unsupervised machine learning and signal processing techniques to identify the different motor unit action potentials present in each recording and measure the firing patterns of each.

					Written in Matlab.
