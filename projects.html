          <br><i> Winner of the "Create a data visualization to navigate educational standards" on Mindsumo. </i>
          <br><br>
          A visualization of educational standards and the
          "cross walks" between them. This is designed as a tool to
          help teachers and other educational workers design well-rounded
          curriculums	that best encompass the skills that children need to learn
          in order to succeed.
          <br><br>
          This visualization includes features such as hover highlighting and tooltips,
          collapsing/expanding, zooming, "sticky" nodes, and graph selection/toggling.
          <br><br>

          Eat or... well just eat and don't crash! <br><br>
          Snake is back! It's the classic game of eat and don't crash,
          only this time your opponent isn't just yourself. Race the AI
          around the board and eat, eat, eat! Better eat fast, because
          in this world, it's not just about survival of the fittest - it's
          about survival of the biggest.

          As Fort Minor would say, <i>"This is 10% luck, 20% skill, 15%
          concentrated power of will, 5% pleasure, 50% pain, and 100% reason to
          REMEMBER THE NAME."</i>

          You just might go down in history as the world's greatest poker player...
          or end up penniless on the streets. The cards have been dealt. The rest
          is up to you.

          <br> A synchronized multicore honeypot that receives data packets and
          detects if they are spam, evil, or vulnerable packets. Command packets
          are received occasionally that updates the listings of spam, evil, or
          vulnerable addresses or gives the honeypot other commands such as
          printing stats. Stats can also be printed via any keystroke.
